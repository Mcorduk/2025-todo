The odin project todo list project, 2025 version.

I will be doing both class version and function version.

TODO:
 Step by Step implementation
- Render The default Todo (all header and footer information)
- There is two example tasks for the default todo
- Render the todos in the default todo

- Make Task form work, render Todo, render tasks's again
- Make TaskDialog button work
- When Form is sent or cancelled, make it disappear


FIX:
- Form validation for required, max, min


IMPROVE:
- Completed tasks can be seen and be uncompleted, readded to todo
- Can make a todo for past dates and times?

- Load the last seen todo when visiting site again
