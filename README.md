The odin project todo list project, 2025 version.

I will be doing both class version and function version.

TODO:
Step by Step implementation

- Make a tab where Completed Tasks can be seen seperately
- Add localStorage

FIX:

- Form validation for required, max, min

IMPROVE:

- Can make a todo for past dates and times?
- Load the last seen todo when visiting site again
