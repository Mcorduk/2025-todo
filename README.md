The odin project todo list project, 2025 version.

I will be doing both class version and function version.

# TODO:

Step by Step implementation

## Functionality

- Ability to add a Todo;
- Colors implemented for priority
- Functions are impure, get's repeated on strict mode
- AM-PM dropdown for addTaskForm
- Add localStorage => remember tasks, remember the last task that was open (#app data-todo-index)

## Style

- Hover Over on Tasks and check mark button to be improved
- Hover Over on Todo's to be added, also a delete button on hover over?
- Make the minute of the hour part above the AM/PM text
- Form Inputs styling

# FIX:

- Icons repeat when a task is added
- Let people slide when 5+ tasks added
- Add 10 todo limit and show it on sidebar 4/10
- Form validation for required, max, min
- Footers Completed text should also be toggling the completedTask section.
- Mobile doesn't have hover over therefore can't interact with tasks and todos, what do?
- Add Todo form buttons out of bounds
- Task Text Overflow, Tasks Header and Desc should end with "..."
- Todo Text Overflow, Todo headers should have a max limit AND text size should be dynamically smaller

# IMPROVE:

- Can make a todo for past dates and times?
- Load the last seen todo when visiting site again
- If No Task "No task here yet"
- If No Todo, a greyed out icon to indicate emptiness
