The odin project todo list project, 2025 version.

I will be doing both class version and function version.

TODO:
Step by Step implementation

- Colors implemented for priority
- Icons repeat when a task is added
- AM-PM dropdown for addTaskForm
- progressing => in progress
- Make a tab for Todos (make it function)
- Add localStorage

FIX:

- Let people slide when 5+ tasks added
- Add 10 todo limit and show it on sidebar 4/10
- Form validation for required, max, min

IMPROVE:

- Can make a todo for past dates and times?
- Load the last seen todo when visiting site again
