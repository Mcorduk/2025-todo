The odin project todo list project, 2025 version.

I will be doing both class version and function version.

TODO:
 Step by Step implementation
- Make a tab where Completed Tasks can be seen seperately

FIX:
- Form validation for required, max, min
- When form is saved, it adds duplicated tasks


IMPROVE:
- Completed tasks can be seen and be uncompleted, readded to todo
- Can make a todo for past dates and times?

- Load the last seen todo when visiting site again
